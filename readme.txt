My game is more of a GUI-based upgrade game, hence the lack of moving objects and collision (Although I have included image manipulation in the boss-key). Since my A Level Coursework was basically this task, I decided to go a different route and make this game inspired by Cookie Clicker. The goal is to get to 1000 coins as fast as possible.

This game only works on Windows as it uses the winsound library. Turn up your volume to hear the sound effects when you win or lose a bet or finish the game.

The resolution is 500 x 445 so it should fit on any modern monitor.

THE CHEAT CODE IS "CASHCASHMONEY" and it gives the player 990 coins so you see the ending without having to actually play the entire game. The boss key is toggled using B.

All images and code are my own so no sources are given.

The results are stored in the "results.txt" file with the game whenever anyone finishes the game. Open it after finishing the game a few times to see the scores. You may encounter a "threading error message" depending on your machine while trying to enter you name at the end of the game but just enter your name anyway as the error has no effect on anything.

Have fun!
